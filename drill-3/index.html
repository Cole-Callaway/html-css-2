        Jazz is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important
        part. In most jazz performances, players play solos which they make up
        on the spot, which requires considerable skill. There is tremendous
        variety in jazz, but most jazz is very rhythmic, has a forward momentum
        called "swing," and uses "bent" or "blue" notes. You can often hear
        "call--and--response" patterns in jazz, in which one instrument, voice,
        or part of the band answers another. (You can hear Ella Fitzgerald and
        Roy Eldridge do "call and response" in Ella's Singing Class.) Jazz can
        express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy. In jazz, you
        may hear the sounds of freedom-for the music has been a powerful voice
        for people suffering unfair treatment because of the color of the skin,
        or because they lived in a country run by a cruel dictator.
